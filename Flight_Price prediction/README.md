# ✈️ Flight Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📖 Project Overview
Flight ticket prices fluctuate based on multiple factors such as airline, route, duration, number of stops, and travel dates. Understanding these patterns is important for both consumers and businesses to make informed pricing and booking decisions.

This project focuses on building a **machine learning regression model** to predict **flight ticket prices** using historical flight data. The project demonstrates a complete data science workflow, from raw data analysis to predictive modeling and evaluation.
