# 🏨 Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Problem Statement
Hotel booking cancellations lead to significant revenue loss and inefficient resource planning for the hospitality industry. Since not all customers who book a hotel actually stay, it becomes important to **predict the likelihood of booking cancellation in advance**.

The objective of this project is to build a **machine learning classification model** that predicts whether a hotel booking will be **cancelled or not**, using historical booking data.

## 📖 Project Overview
This project applies machine learning techniques to analyze hotel booking data and predict cancellation behavior. The solution focuses on **data understanding, feature engineering, and model evaluation** to support better decision-making in hotel operations such as pricing, inventory management, and customer retention strategies.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on hotel booking data  
- Identify key factors influencing booking cancellations  
- Clean and preprocess real-world booking data  
- Build and compare multiple classification models  
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics  
- Demonstrate an end-to-end machine learning workflow

## ⚙️ Machine Learning Models Implemented
The following classification models were trained and evaluated:

- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree Classifier  
- Random Forest Classifier  

These models were compared to identify the most reliable approach for predicting booking cancellations.

---

## 📈 Model Evaluation Strategy
Models were evaluated using:
- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1-Score  
- Confusion Matrix  

Evaluation focused on **balanced performance**, rather than accuracy alone.

## 🧠 Key Findings
- Lead time is one of the strongest predictors of cancellation  
- Tree-based models outperform linear models  
- Random Forest provides the most stable predictions  
- Feature engineering significantly improves model performance
